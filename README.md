This project provides an interactive analytics dashboard and supporting data pipeline for NHL player performance during the 2023–2024 season using advanced possession and takeaway metrics.

## Project Files

### 1. `nhl_scraper.py`
A standalone Python script that:
- Loads advanced NHL player stats from a local CSV (`sportsref.csv`)
- Cleans and processes the data
- Adds two key custom metrics:
  - `Net_Takeaway = TK - GV`
  - `Possession_Score = (CF% + FF%) / 2`
- Generates exploratory visualizations:
  - Top 10 by Possession Score
  - Bottom 10 by Net Takeaway
  - Age vs. Possession bubble chart
- Exports the cleaned dataset to `cleaned_nhl_stats.csv`

### 2. `nhl_dashboard.py`
A fully interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) dashboard that:
- Lets users filter players by team, position, or name
- Displays:
  - Top 10 players by Net Takeaway and Possession Score
  - All players sorted by last name
  - Team-level average stats
  - Age vs. Possession Score bubble chart
  - Annotated scatterplot of team-level efficiency
- Intended for deployment on Streamlit Cloud
